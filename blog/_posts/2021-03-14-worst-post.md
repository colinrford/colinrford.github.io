Pi day, sky day. All over the place! I am currently writing in Atom text editor
and I am achieving an incredibly high combo in power mode. At this point it's
still well under the internet threshold for "impressive." I would need to type
an entire worthless blog post just to get there.

If I had money I would purchase my student debt.

If I had six legs I would be a mutant.

If I had neighbors I would have sixteen.

The max combo is now just half of the full score. I don't think I can write non-
sense for much longer, y'know. But I am really going for that super high score
of over 9000!!! It's easy when writing a pointless "essay" such as this, I guess
it would be an awful lot cooler if I would achieve such a high score while
actually accomplishing something. What an incredible plugin. Everything on Earth
should have feedback like this. This post is actually titled "Worst Post" for a
darned good reason. Once committed I will look like a fool in front of all of my
friends. None of them will talk to me anymore. But it's fine since I finally
scored over 9000.
